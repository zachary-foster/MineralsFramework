# MineralsFramework - Base mod for overhauling the mechanics of rocks and minerals in RimWorld

**This mod does not add any in-game content on its own**, but is required for other mods in the Minerals collection.


## Mechanics added

* Rocks and minerals can yield multiple different products, each with their own probability, stack size, etc.
* Rocks and minerals now yield resources as you mine rather than upon destruction.
* Mining yield is dependent on miner skill.
* Rocks and minerals can now spawn, grow, shrink, and despawn.

## Mods in the Minerals collection

### MineralsRock

Overhaul of the mountains and rocks in RimWorld.

* Adds weather weathered rocks on the boarders of mountains and more solid rocks the deeper you go in (based on roof presence/thickness).
* Makes rocks more distinct in terms of hit points, beauty, and mineability.
* Adds Basalt, since its the most abundant rock on Earth (WTF vanilla RimWorld?)
* Adds river rocks that accumulate near streams
