# MineralsFramework - Base mod for overhauling the mechanics of rocks and minerals in RimWorld

**This mod does not add any in-game content on its own**, but is required for other mods in the Minerals collection:

- MineralsRock
- MineralsRockExtra
- MineralsAreUseful
- MineralsAreShiny
- MineralsAreShinyExtra
- MineralsAreMagical
- MineralsAreCool


## Mechanics added

* Rocks and minerals can yield multiple different products, each with their own probability, stack size, etc.
* Rocks and minerals now yield resources as you mine rather than upon destruction.
* Mining yield is dependent on miner skill.
* Rocks and minerals can now spawn, grow, shrink, and despawn.

## Mods in the Minerals collection

### MineralsRock

Overhaul of the mountains and rocks in RimWorld.

* Adds weather weathered rocks on the boarders of mountains and more solid rocks the deeper you go in (based on roof presence/thickness).
* Makes rocks more distinct in terms of hit points, beauty, and mineability.
* Adds Basalt, since its the most abundant rock on Earth (WTF vanilla RimWorld?)
* Adds river rocks that accumulate near streams


### MineralsAreUseful

* Adds rocks/minerals:
  - claystone mountains, rocks, and boulders
  - sand dunes
  - scoria dunes
  - flint nodules
  - obsidian flows
* Adds the resources:
  - sharp stone
  - obsidian chunks
  - flint chunks
  - clay
  - sand
  - gravel
  - clay bricks
  - concrete
* Adds recipes:
  - clay -> clay bricks
  - chunks -> gravel
  - gravel -> sand
  - sand -> basalt blocks
  - sand -> sandstone blocks
  - clay + sand + gravel + limestone blocks -> concrete
  - limestone blocks -> marble blocks
* Adds equipment:
  - sharp stone knife
  - sharp stone spear
  - sharp stone ax
  - macuahatil
  - fire starting kit
* Adds buildings:
  - Rammed earth walls: clay + sand
  - Concrete walls: concrete
  - Reinforced concrete walls: concrete + steel
* Adds research:
  - Aggregate engineering I (neolithic): Rammed earth walls, clay -> clay bricks
  - Aggregate engineering II (medieval): gravel -> sand, concrete recipe, concrete walls
  - Aggregate engineering III (industrial): reinforced concrete walls
  - Stone casting I (spacer): sand -> basalt blocks, sand -> sandstone blocks, limestone -> marble blocks
