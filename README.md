# Minerals Framework

An overhaul of anything mineable and the foundation for the "Minerals" collection of mods.
This mod **does not add any content to the game**, but provides a framework for other mods to build upon.
Rocks and minerals produced by this framework have the following improvements over vanilla:

- More realistic and organic appearance, supporting different sizes, number of texture, distribution of texture positions, and random scattering
- More customizable mining products, including support for multiple products, product probabilities, and product quantities
- Mining products are randomly dropped while mining instead of all at once when the rock is destroyed
- Miner skill affects amount of resources mined
- Minerals have a "size" that affects how many resources can be mined from them and their appearance
- Minerals can grow, shrink, spawn, and despawn in response to environmental conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, and light levels
- An optional "snowy" texture that appears when enough snow has accumulated nearby

See other mods in the "Minerals" collection to get the full experience:

- **Minerals Rock**: Complete overhaul of mountains and rocks
- **Minerals Rock Extra**: Additional rocks types
- **Minerals Sparkle**: Valuable crystals that can be mined for gems in remote and extreme biomes
- **Minerals Sparkle Extra**: Additional crystal types

- **Minerals Exotic**: Exotic minerals such as glowstone, coldstone, and adamant
- **Minerals Frozen**: Dynamic ice and snow that can be used for building and cooling rooms


## Compatibility

I am not aware of any incompatibilities with other mods, but please let me know if you find any.
